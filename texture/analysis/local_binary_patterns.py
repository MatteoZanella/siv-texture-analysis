class LBP:
    """
    Class used to compute the Local Binary Patterns of an image and the resulting histograms.
    It computes the matrix holding the local representation of the texture for each pixel, i.e. the comparison of each
    pixel with its surrounding neighbours. Then from this matrix it can compute the normalized histogram of each cell
    and the resulting feature vector obtained concatenating each cell's histogram

    An instance of the LBP class holds the LBP matrix of the image used as constructor's parameter, computed during the
    instantiation. The image is padded with zeros, for computing values on image edges.

    The number of neighbours and their distance from the considered pixel can be specified as parameters, the offset
    values are computed as equidistant points on a circumference, in clockwise direction starting from the middle-up
    position, and approximated to the nearest integers in order to obtain the coordinates on the pixels matrix.
    The number of neighbors influence the size of words (neighbors-bit words) and the size of the histogram, which range
    is [0, 2^neighbor - 1].

    For the histogram computation, the image is divided in the certain number of cells which shape is specified as
    parameter. If the cells don't perfectly tile the matrix, the ones on the right and bottom border will be shrunken
    and a warning will be displayed. The histogram of each cell is computed and normalized. A matrix of all histograms
    organized as the cell's placement is saved as an attribute, together with a feature vector representing a view on
    the flattened concatenation of all histograms.

    Args:
        image (PIL.Image): The image that has to be analyzed, it is internally converted in B/W with Image.convert('L')
        cell_shape (int, int): The dimension of each cell in the LBP matrix on which the histograms are computed.
            Default: (16, 16)
        neighbors (int): The number of neighbors considered for each pixel. Default: 8
        distance (int): The distance of the considered neighbors. Default: 1
        fast (bool): If true, uses a numpy-efficient algorithm instead of the definition-like one. Default: True

    Attributes:
        matrix (numpy.ndarray): The Local Binary Patterns matrix computed during the LBP class instantiation
            upon a specified image
        histograms (numpy.ndarray): A matrix containing the cells' histograms, organized as the cells are arranged in
            the Local Binary Patterns matrix
        feature_vtr (numpy.ndarray): A view of the histograms matrix that concatenates all histograms in a single
            vector. The histograms are ordered row by row, from left to right.
            Equivalent to LBP(...).histograms.reshape(-1).
        hist_bins (int): Number of bins, or buckets, used for each histogram. It is the maximum value that a
            pixel's word can represent for the given number of neighbors specified
        neighbors_offsets (numpy.ndarray): A matrix holding in the i-th row the row and column offsets needed to reach
            the i-th neighbor of a pixel
